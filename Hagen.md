The point of this doc is to describe the purpose of /hagen as a separate repo.

In hagen, I am right now

-Iterating and training a Gemini Video analysis model (Vertex) to learn to retell humor from clips. Code is setup to link, analyze, model into variables, as well as giving a text description of scenario and humor type used. The purpose is to use the values provided by this model analysis, and insert them into the marketplace in this repo, and find the best and most relevant data points to provide the service

-Right now, there is a function called /analyze-rate-v1, which takes in links and then analyzes them. Then, it pre-populates a UI that places the content in dimensions, later confirmed by the letrend system (staffers). Then a datapoint is saved to Supabase in a schema shown in /hagen (to be heavily modified for scaling).

-Another page is dedicated for training the humor-analysis function. The point of this is to make available different utility that comes from actually understanding concepts. Meaning any type of theme/tone/vibe matching will be related to the 'fun' in the clips, rather than metadata or script-based inferrence. Regardless of if the model gets it 100% of times, the idea is to insert many items in the marketplace, have letrend "confirm" it's interpretation, and then insert that description in the purchased clip-page where the user interacts with the item. It's point is being like a smart and fun marketing assistant, describing what happening in the clip in a simple way (the original data is longer, but can be truncated for this particular view)

-Similar as above, there is a page dedicated to training a model on "replicability", by watching clips and receiving output in text. Now, this has to do with certain cultural and "personal" understanding on 'how' a business owner (bar, restaurant, café... etc) would likely relate to how tricky or annoying or time consuming (=worth) a concept would be to replicate, as the responsibility of remaking the popular idea is on the business. The model gives a text description of how a marketing assistant, that kind of knows how much a business owner has to do, would describe it's replicability. The /analyze-rate-v1 function already gives tags (target audience, tone, social risk), that can be used in these descriptions.

-Brand profile chat. This is a pre-trained chatmodel using Claude that aims to keep an overall feeling of a marketing assistant asking general questions about team size, how the team works, what they like and don't like. This chat function also allows linking clips on tiktok (that are read by the chat), that can then be appended as descriptive (this user wants this or this), which funnel the service into finding recommendations that may fit well. This chat is meant to give insight into the user and their desires, their goals and their self-perception (are we rising, are we a friendly place, do we have certain image standards).

-(Not developed yet) A brand profile model. Even more not developed yet, is to create a cohesive matching profile identity that connects overall tone/theme/production over 'multiple' clips, not just one, and links it to certain types of brands. So brands have a profile identity, and can be connected to other brands based on the mix of content read and analyzed.
