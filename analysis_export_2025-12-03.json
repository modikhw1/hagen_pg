      "notes": "The video is somewhat amusing and plays on the concept of two colleagues in a restaurant having to share a difficult conversation. The server, having messed up (maybe the order), has to engage with her colleague and explain that something needs to be fixed. The premise being that the staff is fed up, and she feels like it's an emotional process having to recieve criticism or take accountability. The line \"I'm already crying\" is a type of gen z humor of being very emotionally unhealthy or unbalanced, which makes for a somewhat amusing payoff in the situation in question.\n\nThe script relies on a TikTok sound, which tells that the script in itself isn't strong. The script doesn't use dialogue, but rather relies on the TikTok sound, and the facial expressions/movements of the main subject and her colleague, looking at her with a stern look. It's not a very humorous or funny video, but it's maybe relatable and fun to a younger audience, and probably of women more than men.",

The originality is average because this type of POV video is common. The payoff is weak because it doesn't show the woman actually telling the kitchen she messed up. The rewatchability is average because it's a relatable scenario that people might want to share.",

The script isn't very creative, and doesn't have any lines, but rather relies on a funny cutaway of a child dancing. The engaging aspect of this video is how seamless the transition is into the clip of the child dancing. The issue with this script/concept is that it relies on other media, which makes it not as strong alone just based on the script. The issue is the same with music/sound effects, where attention or engagement comes from something other than the premise/script.\n\nThe video has good pacing, isn't very long. But it's tone is quite edgy, and is likely more engaging for a young crowd, and maybe girls. This makes the video not appropriate for a brand looking to cater to a large audience, with both young people and people who are a bit older.",

The script centers around the bartender/barista, preparing two drinks and handing one to the person on the other side of the bar, inviting for some connection over gossip. The person on the other end signals through text on the screen that she would rather not, and then, the person takes back the drink and continues walking, almost as if the person wanting to respect the boundaries of the lives of the others (the subject of gossip), is in the wrong. It's almost like implying that we are living in the \"world\" of the barista, where any perspective other than the one where gossiping is good, isn't appreciated. This gives a funny element to the video. Of course, this type of theme has a lot of personality, and is probably more engaging for a younger, (maybe) female crowd that understand or find enjoyment in this type of attitude being blatantly showcased.\n\nThis script can likely be replicated, and it's clever and funny. But the script would not fit the tone of most brands, perhaps a younger or more hip audience. Also, gossip in general, if being packaged as \"what right\" within a sketch, is a somewhat agitating theme and not wholesome exactly. Gossip, sex are two themes that may go against brand guidelines to make it accessible and wholesome for a general audience.",

Then the second one simply stands there by the drink station, with drinks overfilling the cup and the colleague almost \"off line\", as if checked out mentally. This answers the question indirectly (she's not ok), with a funny visual representation of someone almost traumatized. This is an amusing and absurdist trope, the idea that a hectic service could make a person traumatized. It plays on the trope of a soldier being shocked by a situation, and then being hard to reach for a while after. This becomes a contrast to a restaurant setting, and makes it absurd for that reason.\n\nThe script is funny and original. It relies on a TikTok \"sound\", meaning a ready made sound that is being mimicked by the content creator. Generally, music or \"sounds\" are not good and I prefer clear and original scripts. The script can be replicated somewhat easily. It's not a dialogue heavy script and plays of physical humor, or the dramatic effect of seeing a visual representation of a funny scenario. Overall the pacing is also good, it's not too long or short. ",

When going for the \"bottle flip\" (a popular game for young people, trying to land a half filled bottle on its bottom), the cashier slaps the bottle and makes it impossible to succeed. The video has pacing, and the delivery by the cashier makes it chocking/absurdist, making the viewer think \"wow, that's funny but at the same time mean\". Of course, the viewer gets from the TikTok context that it is simply a sketch/joke. But this type of meanness/cruelty can be funny when viewed in an absurdist context.\n\nThe video is replicatable. The script has originality, and can be reused for any type of business with a cash register. Doesn't require too much setup or editing.",

Then the questioning person says \"and now the slice is triangular\", which makes the dialogue move to another level. It's a funny little disagreement that is centered around an observation.

The barista, who may feel bigger and confident, starts walking into the camera and some music starts playing. This video is short and easy to replicate, but may not be the right tone for other restaurants. In it's current form, it requires a personality to seem \"larger than life\", wanting to exaggerate their unique style or play on that trope. It also contains music, which makes the sketch less capable to stand on it's own. It's short and would likely be engaging for young women, which might be their target audience looking at the tone and the type of video this is.",

Eh, men de hade fått ett bord i baren som hon var jättemissnöjd. Och det var tänk så här, det var fullbokat alltså det var fullt. Folk stod och köade på att få komma in. Eh, och det var jag och en till i servicen bara så ja ja, vi körde på och hon står där och eh matar mig med hur dålig servicen är och hon kommer aldrig komma tillbaka och eh ja, vice versa. Så till slut så eh får jag nog. Så jag vände mig om och jag bara, om inte du nöjd då kan du gå härifrån. Enkelt.

The video is short and uses some physical humor.\n\nI don't think the video is useful for my purposes. First of all, the meme is not known online to be very creative or \"in\", so that any other creator/restaranteur would replicate the script with success. Also, it plays on the character in the cash register being very beautiful, which is a recurring theme which also gives it extra visibility.",

The content creator has that as a recurring joke, and the video is a sort of movie trope about a very serious person that is needlessly serious. The reason why the video doesn't work for the purpose is that other restauranteurs wouldn't copy a concept that plays heavily on an inside/recurring joke. Also, it plays a lot on production value which makes it hard to replicate with a much smaller content budget",

It juxtaposes itself in an amusing way, where tacos is not the place to show of like that, especially not at work as the cashier.\n\nUltimately, for my purposes, it's not a very useful video since the script requires some physical comedy that may be hard to replicate for another restauranteur with another type of food. It would require a similar type of food, say a fast food joint, as well as the owner/worker being a young visually engaging woman.",
